# Artificial Intelligence - Laboratory Exercises

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the laboratory exercises of the **Artificial Intelligence** course at the Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI).

This repository contains all the necessary materials, code templates, and documentation for the lab exercises. It is actively maintained by the course's teaching assistants to support your learning throughout the semester.

## Course Curriculum & Objectives

The laboratory exercises are designed to provide hands-on, practical experience with the core concepts of Artificial Intelligence. The curriculum is comprehensive, covering theoretical paradigms and their implementation to build a strong foundation in the field.

The curriculum includes:

* **Problem-Solving with Search:**
  * State-space representation and formal problem-solving.
  * Uninformed Search Algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search).
  * Heuristic and Informed Search Algorithms (e.g., A*).
  * Adversarial Search for Games (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning).

* **Knowledge, Reasoning, and Logic:**
  * Knowledge representation and logical reasoning.
  * Inference in propositional logic and Bayesian networks.
  * Reasoning with uncertain knowledge.

* **Machine Learning Paradigms:**
  * Inductive and concept learning.
  * Reinforcement learning principles.

* **Expert Systems:**
  * Architecture, knowledge representation, and the creation of rule-based systems.

* **Bio-inspired Computing:**
  * Genetic Algorithms: mechanics, design, and application.
  * Swarm Intelligence: principles and popular algorithms (PSO, ACO).

* **Intelligent Agents:**
  * Understanding agent-based systems, their architectures, and decision-making processes.

All exercises will be implemented in **C++** using the custom **natID** framework, with a strong emphasis on the graphical visualization of algorithm behavior.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by lab sessions. Each exercise will have its own dedicated folder, named sequentially (e.g., `[DSAI-AI] Laboratory Exercise 01`, `[DSAI-AI] Laboratory Exercise 02`, etc.).
